# Python Space Invaders Clone

A faithful recreation of the classic **Space Invaders** arcade game, built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. This project is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and captures the retro charm of the original game with simple graphics, sound effects, and a working score system.

## 🚀 Features

- 🛸 Classic enemy formations and waves
- 🎯 Player-controlled shooting and movement
- 💥 Sound effects for firing and explosions
- 🎨 Custom sprites and retro visuals
- 🧠 Simple, readable code – great for learning game logic

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Arrow Keys**: Move left and right
- **Spacebar**: Fire laser
- Destroy all enemies before they reach the bottom!

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Turtle graphics (included with standard Python installation)

## ▶️ Run the Game

```bash
python space_invaders.py
```

Make sure the `.gif` image files and sound files are in the same directory as the script.
